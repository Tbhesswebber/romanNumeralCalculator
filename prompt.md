# Code Challenge

Please spend about 3 hours on this code challenge.

Holberg Financial is growing fast and we’ve identified our next city for expansion: Rome. The
only problem is Rome still uses Roman numerals and it’s hard for us to coach them when we
have to do the conversions for their finances in our head. You’ll be building a Roman numeral
calculator.

The user should be able to use the calculator to apply basic math operations to Roman
numerals. For example, if the user wanted to add “IV” to “IV”, the result would be “VIII”. If the
user wanted to subtract “I” from “X”, the result would be “IX”. If the user wanted to multiply “M”
by “II”, the result would be “MM”.

The end users for this will be Joe and Colin, so assume that the user is comfortable with the
command line and is familiar with mathy things like postfix notation, if those are some things you
choose to use. Implementation is up to you.

The purpose of this challenge is to find out how you approach building things. It’s not to have a
perfect finished product.

## Additional guidance

- Use whatever technologies you feel comfortable with. We are comfortable reading and writing in multiple languages.
- The perfect is the enemy of the good.
- Imagine you are putting this up for a code review in your professional life. What are some things the reviewers will be looking for?
- When finished, please share your code with us.

### Stretch goal

If you’re still under 3 hours, make a simple web front end so we can use it on the web. Deploy
this project on a free hosting service like Firebase or AWS and make it public on the internet.

### Out of scope

- Authentication
- Handling decimals
- Handling negatives
